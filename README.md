# first_app
It's the first flutter app code by dart.

You’ve written an interactive Flutter app that runs on both iOS and Android. In this codelab, you’ve:

* Created a Flutter app from the ground up.
* Written Dart code.
* Leveraged an external, third party library.
* Used hot reload for a faster development cycle.
* Implemented a stateful widget, adding interactivity to your app.
* Created a lazily loaded, infinite scrolling list displayed with a ListView and ListTiles.
* Created a route and added logic for moving between the home route and the new route.
* Learned about changing the look of your app’s UI using Themes.
